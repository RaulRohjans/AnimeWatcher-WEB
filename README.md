# AnimeWatcher-WEB
This is a website and API made in the django framework that allows users to watch anime episodes for free. The website is uncomplete and some pages are super unoptimized and take ages to load when the project is hosted on a slower machine.

The API works fine but does not respect a lot of the REST structure rules, some of the code is really messy and the naming isn't the best.

This project was never intended to be released to the public and thus why the code is so messy.

Anyone is free to use the code as they like as the project has been abandoned.
